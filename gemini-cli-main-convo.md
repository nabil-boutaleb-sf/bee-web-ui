# Gemini CLI Conversation Log

This file is used to store the conversation with the Gemini CLI agent.

## Conversation Summary (as of 2025-07-02):

- **Persistent Conversations:** We established that conversations aren't saved by default if the container is refreshed. We've created this file, `gemini-cli-main-convo.md`, to manually log our conversation.
- **`/compress` Command:** I was corrected on the existence of the `/compress` command, which can be used to summarize the conversation and reduce token usage.
- **VS Code Integration:** We discussed how to handle diffs opened by the CLI in VS Code. The key is to **close the file tab** in VS Code after reviewing and saving to return control to the CLI.
- **VS Code Diff Shortcuts:** We created a cheat sheet for navigating and managing diffs in VS Code.
  - **Next/Previous Change:** `Option` + `F5` / `Shift` + `Option` + `F5`
  - **Stage/Revert:** Via right-click context menu.
  - **Toggle Inline View:** Via the `...` menu in the editor.
