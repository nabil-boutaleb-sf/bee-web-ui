# Bee Web UI - Conversation Summary

This document summarizes the key decisions and progress for the Bee Web UI project as of **July 2, 2025**.

## Project Goal
To create a simple, personal-use web application to manage "todos" and "facts" from the `bee.computer` API, addressing the difficulty of editing or deleting these items in the official UI.

## Key Decisions & Design Changes
- **Architecture**: We are building a Node.js/Express backend that acts as an API proxy to protect the `BEE_API_TOKEN`. The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **UI Structure**: The initial single-page design was changed to a multi-page application with dedicated pages for `/todos` and `/facts`, and a home page (`/`) to act as a welcome/navigation hub.
- **Official SDK**: We discovered that `bee.computer` provides an official `beeai` SDK for both JavaScript and Python. We have decided to use the `beeai` npm package in our backend (`beeService.js`) instead of writing manual `fetch` requests. This is a major improvement to the plan.
- **Inspiration**: We found a similar community project (`beemcp`) and have added a task to review its repository for UI/UX inspiration, but we will prioritize using the official SDK for our core logic.
- **Language Choice**: We confirmed our choice to stick with the JavaScript/Node.js stack.

## Project Status
- **Setup**: The project structure has been created, including placeholder HTML files (`index.html`, `todos.html`, `facts.html`), a `test.html` page to preserve initial test code, and a `TASKS.md` file.
- **VCS**: The local Git repository has been initialized and connected to the remote GitHub repository at `https://github.com/nabil-boutaleb-sf/bee-web-ui.git`. The initial project files have been committed and pushed.
- **Documentation**: The `DESIGN.md` has been updated to reflect the multi-page layout and other design decisions. This summary file has been created to log progress.

- **Connection Status**: The application successfully displays "status: connected to bee api" on the home page.

## Identified Issues & Current Tasks
- The "Manage Todos" and "Manage Facts" pages are stuck on "loading".
- The "Test" page is currently broken.
- Need to validate that the successful connection status is not a false positive.
- The `bee` folder (containing the SDK) was not committed and needs to be added.

## Recent Actions
- Updated `TASKS.md` to include:
    - Fixing the "stuck on loading" issue for Todos and Facts.
    - Restoring the Test page, preserving the original `test.js` as `public/test.original.js`.
    - Adding a task to validate the connection status.
- Created `test_cases.md` with detailed test cases, user cases, and user stories.
- Committed and pushed the `TASKS.md` and `test_cases.md` changes to GitHub.

## Next Steps
- Commit the `bee` folder to the repository.
- Investigate and fix the "loading" state for Todos and Facts pages.
- Restore the Test page functionality.
- Implement the remaining API endpoints and frontend logic for Todos and Facts.
