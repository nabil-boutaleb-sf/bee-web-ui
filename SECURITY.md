## Security Best Practices for Users

When using the Bee Web UI, especially on shared or public computers, please consider the following:

*   **API Key Storage:** While the application stores your API key securely in a server-side session, it's tied to your browser session. To ensure maximum security, **always clear your browser's cookies and site data for `localhost:3000` (or your deployed domain) after your session, especially if you are using a shared computer.**
*   **Strong API Keys:** Use a strong, unique API key from Bee.computer.
*   **Keep Software Updated:** Ensure your browser and operating system are kept up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.
