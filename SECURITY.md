# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Bee Web UI seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

Please report vulnerabilities by opening a **GitHub Issue** in this repository. 

When creating the issue, please:

*   Provide a clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Describe the potential impact.
*   Suggest any mitigations or fixes (if applicable).

If the vulnerability is highly sensitive and you prefer not to disclose it publicly even in an issue, please indicate this in the issue title (e.g., "[Sensitive] Vulnerability Report"), and we will follow up with you privately to gather more details. We will acknowledge your report within 24-48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 7 days.

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using the Bee Web UI, especially on shared or public computers, please consider the following:

*   **API Key Storage:** While the application stores your API key securely in a server-side session, it's tied to your browser session. To ensure maximum security, **always clear your browser's cookies and site data for `localhost:3000` (or your deployed domain) after your session, especially if you are using a shared computer.**
*   **Keep Software Updated:** Ensure your browser and operating system are kept up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.
