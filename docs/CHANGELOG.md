# Changelog

## July 2025

This document outlines the recent changes made to the Bee Web UI application.

### Project History

#### Initial Setup and Design (July 2, 2025)

- **Project Goal:** To create a simple, personal-use web application to manage "todos" and "facts" from the `bee.computer` API, addressing the difficulty of editing or deleting these items in the official UI.
- **Architecture:** We are building a Node.js/Express backend that acts as an API proxy to protect the `BEE_API_TOKEN`. The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **UI Structure:** The initial single-page design was changed to a multi-page application with dedicated pages for `/todos` and `/facts`, and a home page (`/`) to act as a welcome/navigation hub.
- **Official SDK:** We discovered that `bee.computer` provides an official `beeai` SDK for both JavaScript and Python. We have decided to use the `beeai` npm package in our backend (`beeService.js`) instead of writing manual `fetch` requests. This is a major improvement to the plan.
- **Inspiration:** We found a similar community project (`beemcp`) and have added a task to review its repository for UI/UX inspiration, but we will prioritize using the official SDK for our core logic.
- **Language Choice:** We confirmed our choice to stick with the JavaScript/Node.js stack.
- **Project Status:**
    - The project structure has been created, including placeholder HTML files (`index.html`, `todos.html`, `facts.html`), a `test.html` page to preserve initial test code, and a `TASKS.md` file.
    - The local Git repository has been initialized and connected to the remote GitHub repository at `https://github.com/nabil-boutaleb-sf/bee-web-ui.git`. The initial project files have been committed and pushed.
    - The `DESIGN.md` has been updated to reflect the multi-page layout and other design decisions.
    - The application successfully displays "status: connected to bee api" on the home page.
- **Identified Issues & Current Tasks:**
    - The "Manage Todos" and "Manage Facts" pages are stuck on "loading".
    - The "Test" page is currently broken.
    - Need to validate that the successful connection status is not a false positive.
    - The `bee` folder (containing the SDK) was not committed and needs to be added.
- **Recent Actions:**
    - Updated `TASKS.md` to include:
        - Fixing the "stuck on loading" issue for Todos and Facts.
        - Restoring the Test page, preserving the original `test.js` as `public/test.original.js`.
        - Adding a task to validate the connection status.
    - Created `test_cases.md` with detailed test cases, user cases, and user stories.
    - Committed and pushed the `TASKS.md` and `test_cases.md` changes to GitHub.

#### Further Development (July 3, 2025)

- **Recap of Recent Changes**: Reviewed recent commits, which included repairing the test page, organizing project files, and adding the `beeai` SDK. The `app.js` file was also modified to address the "stuck on loading" issue.
- **Facts Functionality Expanded**: Based on user feedback, the requirements for the "Facts" page have been clarified and expanded. The UI will now explicitly show both confirmed and unconfirmed facts, with buttons to "Confirm" unconfirmed facts and "Delete" any fact. All relevant documentation (`DESIGN.2md`, `TASKS.md`, `test_cases.md`) has been updated to reflect this more detailed requirement.
- **Facts Page Implementation**: Implemented the expanded facts page functionality. This included:
    - Fixing a bug where `bee.confirmFact` was not a function by replacing it with the correct `bee.updateFact` method from the SDK documentation.
    - Improving the UI with a more modern stylesheet.
    - Adding pagination to handle a large number of facts.
    - **Refined Facts Display**: Implemented separate API calls for confirmed and unconfirmed facts to ensure accurate display and movement between lists upon confirmation. The UI now correctly separates and displays confirmed and unconfirmed facts, each with its own pagination and loading indicators.
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated `DESIGN.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `test_cases.md` to reflect the new fact editing feature, the refined facts page display, and the `Gemini.md` research task.

#### Further Development (July 7, 2025)

- **Fact Management Improvements:**
    - **Edit Button Styling:** The edit button on the facts page was disappearing on hover due to a CSS issue. This has been fixed by adding specific styles for the edit button, including a white icon on hover.
    - **Edit Functionality:** The "edit fact" feature was not working due to two issues:
        1.  The server was not parsing the JSON body of the request, which has been fixed by adding the `express.json()` middleware.
        2.  The front-end was not correctly handling the edit and save process. The `editFact` function in `app.js` has been rewritten to provide a more robust and user-friendly editing experience.
    - **Edit Field Size:** The input field for editing a fact was small. It has been enlarged for better usability.
- **Todos Page Overhaul:**
    - **Pagination:** The todos page now features a pagination system, similar to the one on the facts page, to handle a large number of todos.
    - **Separated Lists:** Todos are now separated into "Incomplete" and "Completed" lists for better organization and clarity.
    - **Bug Fixes:** An "error loading todos" message was appearing due to incorrect handling of the API response. This has been resolved by updating the front-end to correctly parse the paginated todo data.
    - **Edit Functionality:** Added the ability to edit todos directly from the UI.
- **Conversations Page:** Fixed a bug that was preventing conversations from loading correctly by ensuring the front-end correctly processes the API response.
- **Test Page Enhancements:**
    - Implemented an isolated test API router (`/test-api`) that makes direct calls to the Bee API, bypassing the main SDK service.
    - Updated `public/test.js` to use this new isolated API endpoint.
    - Added "Confirmed" and "Unconfirmed" sections to the test page.
    - Added breadcrumbs for navigation on the test page.
- **General Bug Fixes & Enhancements:**
    - **API Error Handling:** The error messages for API failures (e.g., failing to update a fact) were generic. The server-side error handling has been improved to provide more specific and helpful error messages to the front-end.
    - **Environment and API Token:**
        - Investigated and identified that the `BEE_API_TOKEN` was being injected as an environment variable, which is why removing the `.env` file did not disconnect the application from the API.
        - Restored the `.env` file with the correct API token.
        - Modified `index.js` to allow the server to start gracefully even if `BEE_API_TOKEN` is not defined, displaying a "not connected" message in the UI instead of crashing.
    - **Code Cleanup:** Removed redundant and verbose logging from `services/beeService.js`.
    - **File Organization:** Moved `CHANGELOG.md` and `bee api screenshots` directory into the `docs` folder.
    - **Documentation Updates:** Updated `TASKS.md`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `test_cases.md` to reflect current project status and future plans.

### Further Development (July 8, 2025)

- **Suggested Todos Investigation:**
    - Investigated the Bee.computer API and SDK for a "suggested" or "unconfirmed" parameter for todos. This confirmed that no such parameter is explicitly documented or discoverable via direct API calls.
    - Contacted the Bee.computer developers for clarification.
    - After contacting the Bee.computer developers, the investigation continued by analyzing the `suggested-todos.mp4` video. This revealed that suggestions are a distinct item type, leading to a new hypothesis that they are delivered via a WebSocket connection.
    - Created a `websocket-test.js` script to listen for events from the Bee API server to test this hypothesis at a later time.
    - Updated `TASKS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to accurately reflect the investigation's timeline and current status.
- **Conversations Page Enhancements:**
    - **Initial Detail View (Modal):** Implemented a modal to display full conversation content, replacing the `alert()` function. This included adding `marked.js` for markdown rendering and basic modal styling.
    - **Modal Styling Correction:** Fixed an issue where adding modal styles overwrote the entire `style.css` file due to incorrect `write_file` usage. The original styles were restored, and modal styles were correctly appended.
    - **Layout Refinement (Modal & Main View):** Adjusted modal `max-width` and `max-height` for better readability of long content. Attempted to improve main view layout by changing `li` flex properties, which initially caused new formatting issues.
    - **UI Pattern Change (Accordion):** Replaced the modal with an accordion UI for a better user experience, allowing in-place expansion of conversation details. This involved removing modal-related HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and.
    - **Accordion UI/UX Improvements:**
        - Increased the main content area width (`.main-wide`) for better use of screen space.
        - Made conversation titles (`short_summary`) more prominent using `<h3>` tags.
        - Added a chevron icon and a text fade-out effect to visually indicate expandability and hidden content in the accordion.
    **Markdown Rendering & Layout Debugging:**
        - **Initial Markdown Parser Issue:** Identified that `marked.js` was not correctly rendering bullet points and tables, causing them to appear as broken "cells."
        - **Library Swap Attempt:** Replaced `marked.js` with `markdown-it.js` to address markdown parsing inconsistencies.
        - **Loading Issue & CDN Fix:** Discovered that `markdown-it.js` was not loading due to an incorrect CDN link (pointing to a Cloudflare login page). The CDN link was corrected to a valid jsDelivr URL.
        - **CSS Conflict Resolution (User Implemented):** The persistent markdown formatting issues (bullet points as tables) were resolved by direct user intervention in `public/style.css` (lines 76-122). This fix correctly addresses the CSS conflicts that were preventing proper rendering of markdown-generated block elements within conversation list items.

### Further Development (July 9, 2025)

- **Bulk Actions Implementation:**
    - Implemented bulk actions for both Todos and Facts pages, allowing users to delete, complete, confirm, or unconfirm multiple items at once.
    - Added corresponding API endpoints (`/api/todos/bulk-delete`, `/api/todos/bulk-complete`, `/api/facts/bulk-delete`, `/api/facts/bulk-confirm`, `/api/facts/bulk-unconfirm`) and service functions.
    - Included comprehensive logging on the backend to aid in debugging.
- **Conversations Page:**
    - Added pagination to the conversations page to improve performance and user experience when dealing with a large number of conversations.

### Further Development (July 10, 2025)

- **Search Functionality:**
    - **Backend:** Implemented server-side search for the Todos, Facts, and Conversations pages. Since the Bee API doesn't support a search parameter, the backend now fetches a comprehensive list of items, filters them based on the search term, and then returns the paginated results.
    - **Frontend:**
        - Added search bars to the Todos, Facts, and Conversations pages.
        - The UI now sends the search query to the backend when loading data.
        - The current search query is now preserved after performing actions (e.g., deleting a fact, completing a todo), ensuring a seamless user experience.
    - **UI Improvements:** The search bar has been styled for a more modern and consistent look across the application.
- **Merge Conflict Resolution:** Resolved significant merge conflicts between the `feat/search-functionality-and-playwright` and `fixes` branches, integrating the latest changes from both.
- **Playwright Environment Setup & Debugging:**
    - Identified and resolved issues preventing Playwright tests from running in the development container.
    - **Root Cause:** The container environment was missing essential system-level browser dependencies, and the Playwright browser binaries were not installed.
    - **Solution:** Migrated the development container to use an official Playwright Docker image (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy`), which includes all necessary browsers and system dependencies pre-installed. Updated `Dockerfile` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` accordingly.
    - **Debugging Steps:** Involved systematically checking server startup, browser navigation to external sites, and analyzing Playwright's detailed error messages to pinpoint the missing dependencies.

### Further Development (July 12, 2025)

- **Todos Pagination Enhancements:**
    - Added necessary pagination placeholder `div` elements to `public/todos.html` to ensure pagination controls are rendered correctly.
    - Implemented explicit filtering in `services/beeService.js` for todos based on their `completed` status, addressing an issue where incomplete todos were appearing in the completed list due to inconsistencies in the Bee AI SDK's filtering.
- **Playwright Configuration:**
    - Configured Playwright to run in headless mode in `playwright.config.js` to resolve issues with launching a headed browser in environments without an X server.
- **Conversation Accordion Cursor Fix:**
    - Addressed a UI issue where the cursor was a "clicker" pointer outside the clickable area of conversation accordion items. The `cursor: pointer` style was removed from the main `.conversation-item` CSS rule in `public/style.css`, ensuring it is only applied to the interactive `.trigger-container` element.
- **Playwright Test Stability:**
    - Improved the stability of the Playwright test for conversation accordion expansion and collapse (`tests/conversations.spec.js`). This was achieved by adding a `page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` and increasing the `setTimeout` duration within the `page.waitForFunction` call, ensuring the accordion panel's content fully settles before `maxHeight` is captured.
