# Bee Web UI - Conversation Summary

This document summarizes the key decisions and progress for the Bee Web UI project as of **July 2, 2025**.

## Project Goal
To create a simple, personal-use web application to manage "todos" and "facts" from the `bee.computer` API, addressing the difficulty of editing or deleting these items in the official UI.

## Key Decisions & Design Changes
- **Architecture**: We are building a Node.js/Express backend that acts as an API proxy to protect the `BEE_API_TOKEN`. The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **UI Structure**: The initial single-page design was changed to a multi-page application with dedicated pages for `/todos` and `/facts`, and a home page (`/`) to act as a welcome/navigation hub.
- **Official SDK**: We discovered that `bee.computer` provides an official `beeai` SDK for both JavaScript and Python. We have decided to use the `beeai` npm package in our backend (`beeService.js`) instead of writing manual `fetch` requests. This is a major improvement to the plan.
- **Inspiration**: We found a similar community project (`beemcp`) and have added a task to review its repository for UI/UX inspiration, but we will prioritize using the official SDK for our core logic.
- **Language Choice**: We confirmed our choice to stick with the JavaScript/Node.js stack.

## Project Status
- **Setup**: The project structure has been created, including placeholder HTML files (`index.html`, `todos.html`, `facts.html`), a `test.html` page to preserve initial test code, and a `TASKS.md` file.
- **VCS**: The local Git repository has been initialized and connected to the remote GitHub repository at `https://github.com/nabil-boutaleb-sf/bee-web-ui.git`. The initial project files have been committed and pushed.
- **Documentation**: The `DESIGN.md` has been updated to reflect the multi-page layout and other design decisions. This summary file has been created to log progress.

- **Connection Status**: The application successfully displays "status: connected to bee api" on the home page.

## Identified Issues & Current Tasks
- The "Manage Todos" and "Manage Facts" pages are stuck on "loading".
- The "Test" page is currently broken.
- Need to validate that the successful connection status is not a false positive.
- The `bee` folder (containing the SDK) was not committed and needs to be added.

## Recent Actions
- Updated `TASKS.md` to include:
    - Fixing the "stuck on loading" issue for Todos and Facts.
    - Restoring the Test page, preserving the original `test.js` as `public/test.original.js`.
    - Adding a task to validate the connection status.
- Created `test_cases.md` with detailed test cases, user cases, and user stories.
- Committed and pushed the `TASKS.md` and `test_cases.md` changes to GitHub.

## Next Steps
- Commit the `bee` folder to the repository.
- Investigate and fix the "loading" state for Todos and Facts pages.
- Restore the Test page functionality.
- Implement the remaining API endpoints and frontend logic for Todos and Facts.

*July 3, 2025*
- **Recap of Recent Changes**: Reviewed recent commits, which included repairing the test page, organizing project files, and adding the `beeai` SDK. The `app.js` file was also modified to address the "stuck on loading" issue.
- **Continuation of Work**: The session began by reviewing `DESIGN.md` to determine the next steps. An attempt was made to create the `.env` file for the API token as specified in the design, but this action was cancelled by the user.
- **Facts Functionality Expanded**: Based on user feedback, the requirements for the "Facts" page have been clarified and expanded. The UI will now explicitly show both confirmed and unconfirmed facts, with buttons to "Confirm" unconfirmed facts and "Delete" any fact. All relevant documentation (`DESIGN.md`, `TASKS.md`, `test_cases.md`) has been updated to reflect this more detailed requirement.
- **Facts Page Implementation**: Implemented the expanded facts page functionality. This included:
    - Fixing a bug where `bee.confirmFact` was not a function by replacing it with the correct `bee.updateFact` method from the SDK documentation.
    - Improving the UI with a more modern stylesheet.
    - Adding pagination to handle a large number of facts.
    - **Refined Facts Display**: Implemented separate API calls for confirmed and unconfirmed facts to ensure accurate display and movement between lists upon confirmation. The UI now correctly separates and displays confirmed and unconfirmed facts, each with its own pagination and loading indicators.
- **User Preference Noted**: The user prefers to run the server manually using `npm start` in a separate terminal.
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated `DESIGN.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `test_cases.md` to reflect the new fact editing feature, the refined facts page display, and the `Gemini.md` research task.
